*** App User Workflow

The Academia OS appâ€™s user interface displays a left-sidebar that guides the user through a Workflow (this is an AI Powered Grounded Theory research workflow using the Gioia model). 

New workflows can be added as tabs and returned to at any time.

Many but not all of the previous steps can be accessed via a Previous button (some Previous buttons take you to the last MAJOR step rather than MINOR step.

**Workflow Legend**: <button> [label]

The five steps in the Workflow are:

**Step [1 Find]** - Upload PDFs OR <enter search terms> in search field and <click enter> > to find papers via Semantic Scholar 

> (loading animation with scaffolding)

**Step [2 Explore]** - On loading of content user can explore papers (papers are listed with title, url and abstract) 

**Step [3 Evaluate]** - add custom columns by clicking empty text field eg. [Keywords] and [Research Questions] and clicking <enter>
> cells in these columns are then immediately GENERATED by the AI based on analysis of the papers) and > dynamically load into the table

**Step [4 Coding]** - Add/choose tentative research question from en empty text field which displays a list of suggestions when clicked 
> user can click <Start Coding> to proceed
> new interface appears - a table loaded with title (and other key info), abstract and an extra column for [Initial Codes] which are immediately generated by AI and begin to appear immediately and load into the column
> 2nd Order Coding begins immediately thereafter 
> [Aggregate Dimensions] begins immediately thereafter 
> the Aggregate Dimensions appear immediately thereafter as a mermaid js diagram
> user can click <Next button>  

**Step [5 Modelling]** - user can add tentative research question or free-text remarks into empty text field then click <Start Modeling> button 
> new table with columns: || Theory  ||  Description || Related Dimensions  ||  Possible Research Questions || is generated 
> immediately thereafter system finds [Interrelationships] (user does not ever see the Interrelationships)
> immediately thereafter [Visualization] of theoretical model appears as a mermaid js diagram
> MISSING FUNCTIONALITY/STEP: USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO CRITIQUE THEORETICAL MODEL AS HUMAN IN THE LOOP
