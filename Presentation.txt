8. RESPONSIVE LAYOUT PATTERN

Purpose: Adaptive layout with Ant Design integration

Implementation:
- Layout components with responsive behavior
- Theme-aware styling using Ant Design tokens
- Flexible grid system
- Consistent spacing and typography

Layout Structure:
- Header with navigation
- Content area with padding
- Footer with attribution
- Sidebar integration for monitoring

Key Files:
- src/Components/Root.tsx
- src/Components/Footer.tsx

Benefits:
- Consistent visual design
- Theme integration
- Responsive behavior
- Professional layout structure

9. SERVICE LAYER INTEGRATION PATTERN

Purpose: Clean separation between UI and business logic

Implementation:
- Service calls from component event handlers
- Error handling with user feedback
- Loading states during service operations
- Configuration validation before service calls

Integration Examples:
- ChatService for AI model interactions
- SearchService for paper discovery
- HeliconeService for monitoring
- PDFService for document processing

Benefits:
- Separation of concerns
- Centralized business logic
- Consistent error handling
- Testable components
