<h1 align="center">AcademiaOS 2.0</h1>

Welcome to **AcademiaOS**, a solution for academic information retrieval and reasoning! We've built this on a robust large language model platform equipped with a bouquet of features dedicated to providing the best assistance for researchers possible.

For a deeper understanding of the underlying technology and concepts, you can refer to Thomas √úllebecker's paper: [AcademiaOS: Automating Grounded Theory Development in Qualitative Research with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08844).

## üåü Features 

* **Model Chooser**: Choose Anthropic or OpenAI options and enter your own API keys for NLP.
* **Find Academic Papers**: Building on the SemanticScholar corpus and OpenAI embeddings, AcademiaOS finds and ranks relevant papers to your search queries. 
* **Upload PDFs**: If you have curated papers or other qualitative documents (such as interview transcripts) as PDFs, you can upload them for downstream tasks. Text-PDFs are handled in-browser while scanned PDFs are OCRd using Adobe PDF Extract API.
* **Mass Information Extraction**: Structurally extract information (such as a paper's sentiment towards your thesis or information such as the count of study participants) from papers at scale.
* **Structured Literature Review**: Utilise Semantic Scholar to navigate papers with a clean and intuitive interface.
* **Coding of Qualitative Literature**: AI coding of interviews, social media posts or other qualitative literature.
* **Automated Theory Construction**: Get a draft theoretical model explaining your qualitative data in just a few steps.

## üîß Getting Started 

Tech Stack:
- ReactJS
- AntDesign (Component Library)
- LangChainJS (Composability with Large Language Models)
- SemanticScholarJS (Interaction with Semantic Scholar)
- Anthropic and/or OpenAI (Extract theoretical propositions via NLP)

To get started with AcademiaOS, you require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed in your machine.

1. Use `git clone` to clone this repository.
