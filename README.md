<h1 align="center">AcademiaOS 2.0</h1>

Welcome to **AcademiaOS 2.0**, your solution for academic information retrieval and reasoning! We've built this modernised fork of AcademiaOS on Thomas √úllebecker's [AcademiaOS](https://github.com/thomasuebi/academia-os), a robust large language model platform equipped with a bouquet of features dedicated to providing unrivalled assistance for researchers.

**AcademiaOS 2.0** includes the ability to choose your main foundation model for inference from Anthropic or OpenAI (while retaining critical OpenAI use for SemanticScholar and embeddings) as well as a number of UI improvements such as better transparency to user regarding processes as they are invoked, better Helicone integration including a sidebar to view Helicone monitoring of inference, and other updates under the hood such as critical updates to LangChain and its associated OpenAI module, and addition of LangChain's Anthropic module.

For a deeper understanding of the underlying technology and concepts, you can refer to Thomas √úllebecker's ground-breaking paper: [AcademiaOS: Automating Grounded Theory Development in Qualitative Research with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08844).

## üåü Features 

* **Choose your AI Model**: From Anthropic or OpenAI by adding your API Keys (an OpenAI key is always required for embeddings)
* **Source Academic Literature**: Building on the SemanticScholar corpus and OpenAI embeddings, AcademiaOS finds and ranks relevant papers to your search queries.
* **Instantly Extract Key Data from Papers**: View the Title and Abstract of papers and add columns for Findings, Variables etc. with a click.
* **Upload PDFs**: If you have curated papers or other qualitative documents (such as interview transcripts) as PDFs, you can upload them for downstream tasks. Text-PDFs are handled in-browser while scanned PDFs are OCRd using Adobe PDF Extract API.
* **Information Extraction at Scale**: Structurally extract information (such as a paper's sentiment towards your thesis or information such as the count of study participants) from papers at scale.
* **Thematic Literature Analysis**: Navigate literature via Semantic Scholar with a clean and intuitive interface, and auto-code themes.
* **Coding of Qualitative Data**: Let AI preliminarily code your interviews, social media posts or other qualitative literature, and export as .csv for refinement in your CAQDAS software.
* **Proposed Theory Construction**: Output a proposed theoretical model from your qualitative data, as a Mermaid diagram, in just a few steps and apply your own human-in-the-loop critique to outputs.
* **Monitor Inference with Helicone**: Updated async integration with HeliconeAI's open-source LLM observability platform for developers to monitor, debug, and improve production-ready applications.

## üîß Getting Started 

Tech Stack:
- ReactJS
- AntDesign (Component Library)
- LangChainJS (Composability with Large Language Models)
- SemanticScholarJS (Interaction with Semantic Scholar)
- Anthropic and/or OpenAI (Extract theoretical propositions via NLP)

To get started with AcademiaOS, you require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed in your machine.

1. Use `git clone` to clone this repository. 
2. Run `npm install`.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Mode  

### `npm start`

Initiates the application in the development mode.\
Use [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application on your browser.

The application reloads automatically if any edits are made.\
Any lint errors are visible in the console.

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Visit the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for further information.

## üè≠ Production Build 

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application for production into the `build` folder.\
Efficiently bundles React in the production mode and optimizes the build to deliver optimum performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your application is now ready for deployment!

Visit the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for an in-depth understanding.
